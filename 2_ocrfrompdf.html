This eliminates the need for manual tagging and keyword guessing, as the API can<br>recommend relevant tags based on the visual content of the image.<br>To demonstrate the usage of the Google Vision API for detecting web entities and pages, we will use Python.<br>First, we define the file names of the images we want to analyze. In this example, we have three images: a cat,<br>a popular web image, and a photo taken in Japan.<br>Next, we open each image and pass the byte data to a content object. This content object is then used to<br>construct an image object using the vision module. Once the image object is created, we can make use of the<br>web_detection method from the client instance to obtain the response.<br>The response object contains a list of results, including web entities, visually similar images, and best-guess<br>labels. Web entities provide recommended tags that can be associated with the image, while visually similar<br>images are images found on the web that closely resemble the uploaded image. The best-guess label<br>represents the label name that can be used for the image.<br>To extract the web detection response, we create a web detection object and reference the web detection<br>attribute from the response object. This object provides several methods to access different elements of the<br>detection, such as best-guess labels, full match images, partial matching images, and pages with matching<br>images.<br>By calling these methods, we can retrieve the corresponding attributes of each element. For example, the best-<br>guess label attribute returns the recommended label associated with the image, while the full match images<br>attribute provides a list of images that are identical to the uploaded image. The partial matching images<br>attribute returns a list of images that partially match the uploaded image.<br>Furthermore, the API allows us to search for visually similar images. By clicking on the links provided in the<br>response, we can view these visually similar images in the Chrome browser. This can help users explore<br>different images recommended by Google based on their similarity to the uploaded image.<br>The Google Vision API provides a convenient way to detect web entities and pages based on visual data. By<br>utilizing the Web Detection feature, users can search for similar images, generate tags for uploaded images,<br>and explore visually similar images recommended by the API.<br>When using the Google Vision API for web detection and web entities, the results obtained are presented in the<br>form of a list. To extract the relevant information, it is necessary to iterate through each element of the list. This<br>can be achieved by implementing a loop. In this loop, the description and confidence score of each entity can be<br>printed. The entity ID can be ignored for now.<br>By running this loop, a list of recommended tags suggested by the Vision API will be displayed. It is important to<br>note that the script provided encompasses the entire process.<br>To demonstrate the functionality using a different image, a new image can be selected and the process can be<br>repeated. In the example, an image downloaded from the web is utilized. It is essential to ensure that the file<br>extension is removed before running the script. Once this is done, a greater number of results will be obtained<br>based on the uploaded image.<br>The Vision API is capable of identifying various details about the image, such as the location where it was taken<br>and the device used. In addition to this, the API also provides a method to obtain matching images. These<br>matching images are identical to the uploaded image. By opening one of the provided links, it is possible to<br>view the image and access the webpage associated with it. It is important to note that not all links will be<br>functional, as some may result in a \"page not found\" error.<br>Furthermore, the Vision API allows for the identification of visually similar images from different websites. By<br>selecting a different link, it is possible to access the same image from a different website. This information can<br>be useful when searching for pages that contain matching images.<br>The API also provides additional information, such as the webpage URL, title, and the image link from the<br>EITCI<br>O2024 European IT Certification Institute<br>EITCI, Brussels, Belgium, European Union<br>2/7<br>EITC/AI/GVAPI GOOGLE VISION API<br>☐<br>PEITC<br>EUROPEAN IT CERTIFICATION CURRICULUM SELF-LEARNING PREPARATORY MATERIALS<br>website.
